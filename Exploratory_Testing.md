- Tried submitting form multiple times quickly
- Tested browser refresh during login
- Entered special characters in input fields
- Checked behavior when fields are left empty

Observations:
- Application handles most cases correctly
- Error messages are clear and visible
-------------------------------------------------------

## Disappearing Elements – Exploratory Testing

Observations:
- Navigation menu item (Gallery) appear and disappear randomly on page reload
- The behavior changes with each refresh
- No error messages are displayed

Conclusion:
This behavior is expected and intentionally implemented to demonstrate dynamic UI behavior.
